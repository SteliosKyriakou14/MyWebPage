      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">I am Stelios Kyriakou and I graduated first of my class the degree of <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>.
        At the moment I am on my 3rd semester of my MSc in <strong>Communications Engineering</strong> at the RWTH Aachen univerity.
        <br><br>Welcome to my personal webpage and with it, I would like to show my work experience and skills

        <h3 class="skill" >C language</h3>
        <p> The C programming language was the first programming language that I ever learned to code.
          Its fair to say that I can code on an intermediate to advanced level since I had practical experience throughout my studies during which
          I had successfully finished various lab courses including 2 programming courses with C during my bachelor studies and the network programming lab during my master studies.</p>

        <h3 class="skill">Matlab</h3>
        <p>In my current semester I am taking a <strong>Matlab Advanced: for signal processing laboratory</strong>.</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>During this laboratory we started with an introduction to the basics of Matlab (variables, operators, functions, data types & data structures, visualization, histograms, etc)</li>
          <li>Then moved on to the signal processing part using Matlab:
            <ul>
              <li>Signal Analysis (statistical properties (<strong>mean,variance,max,min</strong>), amplitude modulation (<strong>AM</strong>), quantization, <strong>DFT</strong>)</li>
              <li>Filter Design (<strong>FIR, IIR, Digital Filter Design</strong>)</li>
              <li>Adaptive Filtering for acoustic echo cancellation (Normalised Least-Mean-Square (<strong>NLMS</strong>) adaptive algorithm)</li>
              <li>Matlab C API (<strong>calling C functions</strong> from Matlab (<strong>mex functions</strong>)) </li>
              <li>Multi-Channel Signal Processing</li>
              <li>Noise Reduction by Beamforming</li>
              <li>Spatial Signal Processing</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="skill">Python</h3>
        <p> My first experience with Python was during an Internship in my bachelor studies, where I participated in an ongoing project regarding
          a <strong>low cost and real time monitoring of a laboratory scale power system</strong> (see below).</p>

        <p> This semester I am taking a <strong>mashine learning</strong> course and as we cover the lecture materials I am doing an online course in <strong>Udemy</strong> called:
          <strong>Mashine Learning A-Z: hands on Python in Data Science</strong> in order for me to get more practical experience on the matter.
        </p>

        <p> This course includes tutorials of all core algorithms and principles of ML like:
        <ol>
          <li>Regression Techniques</li>
          <li>Classification: K-NN, K-Means, EM Algorithm (GMM), Linear Discriminants, SVMs</li>
          <li>Deep Learning: ANN,CNN </li>
          <li>Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA)</li>
        </ol> all implemented through Jupyter Notebook. </p>

        <h3 class="skill">HTML / CSS</h3>
        <p>Coding in HTML and CSS is more like a personal hobby of mine. In order to show my skills on HTML and CSS I created my <strong>personal webpage</strong>
          while also to show with it my most essential technical skills and experiences in more detail. </p>

        <h3>Network Programming Laboratory</h3>
        <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Basic email client based on SMTP and POP</p>

        <p> During my first semester of my master studies at RWTH Aachen Univerity I attended a network programming laboratory in which we worked on various assignments
          (echo server & client, http webserver using TCP, ipv4/ipv6, etc) in groups of 2. For The final task was to we created an <strong>email client</strong>
          for sending and receiving (text based) emails using the <strong>SMTP</strong> and <strong>POP3</strong> protocols respectively while also using the TLS (transport layer security) protocol,
          which is required for communicating with email-servers.
        <p>Functionalities of our email-client are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>sending emails, with the option to have multiple recipients</li>
          <li>checking mailbox</li>
          <li>reading the text of a specific email, with the option to reply or forward</li>
          <li>deleting email from mailbox</li>
        </ol>

        <p> During my final year of my bachelor studies I worked on implementing an <strong>Opto-Electronic-Oscillator (OEO)</strong> for generating ultra-high qiality x-band signals.
          OEOs are a unique type of RF feedback oscillators in which the resonator is replaced with an optical delay-line fibre carrying an intensity modulated laser beam.
          This implementation takes advantage of the fact that optical fibers offer low attenuation with flat frequency response over the modulated bandwidth as well as the long delays thus OEOs can generate signals with high spectral purity.
          My work mainly focused on improving the quality of the generated signal by trying out defferent OEO topologies which acted as microwave-photonic filters.
          As a final result I managed to implement an OEO design with phase noise as low as -80dB at 10 khz offset frequency and an operating frequency of up to 10 GHz.</p>

          <li> <strong>Project Title:</strong> Power forecast of a Photovoltaic panel using Matlab's Artificial Neural Network Toolbox</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this project I was given weather forecast of a specified location and the corresponding power generated from a PV panel located to the same location.
          Then my task was to try to predict the power generated from the PV panel given new fresh weather forecast data</p>
